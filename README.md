## 🌀 About

Circular Mesh Harmony is an interactive, generative art piece that explores the beauty of geometric patterns through motion and repetition. This project uses p5.js to create mesmerizing animations of concentric circles and arcs, resulting in complex, ever-changing designs.

## 🎨 Features

- **Dynamic Patterns**: Utilizes various geometric configurations to create diverse visual effects
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Clean black and white color scheme for maximum visual impact
- **Randomized Elements**: Ensures a unique experience with each viewing

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Download the project files
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser
3. Sit back and enjoy the hypnotic dance of circles!

## 🎭 Customization

Feel free to experiment with the code to create your own unique patterns:

- Modify the `comb` array in `sketch.js` to add new geometric configurations
- Adjust the `step` and timing variables to change the animation speed and scale
- Play with the stroke weight and color to achieve different visual effects
